# Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Shortest Path)

## Overview
An implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. This project was created to strengthen my understanding of graph traversal and algorithmic problem solving.

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Project Details
The algorithm works by starting from a source node and repeatedly selecting the nearest unvisited node. Distances to neighbouring nodes are updated until the shortest paths to all reachable nodes are found.

## What I Learned
- How weighted graphs are represented in code
- How Dijkstra’s algorithm guarantees the shortest path
- The importance of selecting the nearest unvisited node at each step
- How algorithm efficiency can be improved using appropriate data structures

## Notes
This project was created as part of my learning process and focuses on clarity and correctness rather than optimisation.
